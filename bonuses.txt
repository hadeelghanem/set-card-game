BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

- we used the given files and the env to call configuration fields instead of using magic numbers.
- we used it in:
the class table in the methods placeCard() and removeCard().
the class Player in the methods run(), point(), penalty(), createArtificialIntelligence() and fillTheList.
the class Dealer in the methods run() handleValidSet(), findEmptySlots(), updateTimerDisplay and findFilledSlots().
the class timer in the constructor and in the updateCountdown() method.
- we runned examples to check that it's true.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

- we used join() in the function terminate() in the class Players and iterated over the list of the threads from the end to the beginning in the dealer terminate() function.
- in the Player class and in the Dealer class.
- after the end of the game the code prints "thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " terminated.", we did a test and check the order of the printing.


--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

- if config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0 we checked this at the beginning of the run function in dealer class and if true we called env.ui.dispose() function.
if config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0 we didn't exactly understand what is this bonus
- in the run() method in the Dealer class.
- we changed the TurnTimeoutSeconds in the config.properties file to several values and did a test.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
